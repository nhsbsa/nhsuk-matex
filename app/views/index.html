      <h1>Maternity Exemption prototype</h1>
    

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>This prototype will contain multiple iterations of solutions to provide a simple to use digital maternity exemption application. 
       <p>Since April 2022, the UCD team have revisted the service to improve the user journey so that it better aligns with GDS standards 
        and to improve uptake of the digital service.</p>
       
        <br>
        
        <p>Below you will find multiple versions of the prototype, including:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>the 'as is' journey, completed in April 2022. This includes the update made to the maternity exemption sevice in to the new NHSUK toolkit</li>
         <li>the MVP journey, currently being looked at by the UCD team. This includes quick-wins, such as a postcode lookup</li>
         <li>the MVP journey plus pregnancy loss content, also currently being looked at by the UCD team</li>
      </ul>
